Now, if you've ever been on the internet, you probably know that the people you interact with, are not always who they claim to be or real at all. Which is an issue, especially if your app relies on your users trusting each other. Be it a marketplace app or just a close-nit social platform, in today's age you may need to have a way to verify your users.

That's how MorpheusId came to be. But that's been a while ago, a hobby and startup that consumed a lot of time. So because of that, I really wanted to use the opportunity of this program to add whatever I can to the project from a technical point of view. 

So this is what we set up on, together with my colleagues here we chose for this project to create some optional addons to the main application that deal with identity verification in one way or another.

Problems we had were the following:
- lack of real time id tracking in the MorpheusId system made the UX seem clunky and unreliable causing higher hosting costs
- no analysis on criminal records
- SEON email verification
- CNP validation

So our projects consists of a bundle of tools that aim to fix these issues
